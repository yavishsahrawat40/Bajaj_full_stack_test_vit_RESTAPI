# VIT Full Stack Assessment API

This is a REST API built as part of an assessment. The API processes an array containing numbers, alphabets, and special characters and returns a structured JSON object with the processed data.

## Features âœ¨

* Parses an incoming array of mixed data types.
* Separates numbers into dedicated arrays for **odd** and **even** values.
* Identifies and collects all alphabetic strings, converting them to uppercase.
* Calculates the **sum** of all numerical values in the array.
* Generates a unique `concat_string` by joining all alphabets, reversing the result, and applying alternating capitalization.
* Gracefully handles requests and returns a consistent JSON response structure.
